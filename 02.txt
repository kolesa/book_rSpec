Chapter 2


 Hello  


All  good  programming  language  books  start  with  the  obligatory  
Hello
World example. Although RSpec is not an all-purpose programming lan- guage, 
it is sometimes described as a domain-specific language (DSL), for 
describing the behavior of objects.  Similarly, Cucumber is a DSL for 
describing the behavior of applications.

To satisfy this requirement, we’ll write Hello  examples for both RSpec and 
Cucumber. But first things first, let’s get the environment set up.
