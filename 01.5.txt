1.5  The BDD Cycle

At each green point in the RSpec cycle, we’ll check the Cucumber cycle.
If  it  is  still  red,  the  resulting  feedback  should  guide  us  to  
the  next action in the RSpec cycle. If it is green, we can jump out to 
Cucumber, refactor if appropriate, and then repeat the cycle by writing a 
new failing Cucumber step.
In  the  next  chapter,  we’ll  get  you  set  up  with  Cucumber  and  
RSpec and  walk  you  through  a  simple  example  of  each  tool.  In  the 
 tutorial that begins in Chapter 3, Describing Features, on page 37, we’ll 
use a number of features in Cucumber and RSpec. In most cases, we’ll only 
touch the surface of a feature, covering just enough to be able to use it 
as needed for this project, with references to other places in the book 
where  you  can  go  to  learn  more  of  the  detail  and  philosophy  
behind each feature.

3.  Although we use Cucumber to focus on high-level behavior and use 
RSpec to focus
on more granular behavior, each can be used for either purpose.

(start with Cucumber)

1 Focus on one scenario

2 Write failing step definition

(drop down to RSpec)


Repeat #1–#7
when scenario is passing


3 Write failing example

4 Get the example to pass

5 Refactor



Repeat #3–#5 until step is passing


Repeat #2–#7 until scenario is passing
(when step is passing)
