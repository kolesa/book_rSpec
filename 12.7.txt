12.7  What We’ve Learned

In this chapter, we covered quite a bit about the approach RSpec takes to  structuring  and  organizing  executable  code  examples.  We  learned that we can do the following:

•  Declare an example group using the describe( ) method

•  Declare an example using the it( ) method

•  Declare an example to be pending by either omitting the block or using the pending( ) method inside the block

•  Nest example groups for cohesive organization

•  Declare  code  to  be  run  before,  after,  and  around  examples  with hooks

•  Define helper methods within an example group that are available to each example in that group

•  Share examples across multiple groups

But what about the stuff that goes inside the examples? We’ve used a couple of expectations in this chapter, but we haven’t really discussed them. The next chapters will address these lower-level details, as well as introduce some of the peripheral tooling that is available to help you nurture your inner BDD child and evolve into a BDD ninja.
