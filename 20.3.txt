20.3  What We’ve Learned

Like most important development decisions, when choosing a step definition  style,  there  are  opposing  forces  on  each  side  that  need to  be considered and balanced. Direct Model Access step definitions offer the speed and flexibility of model specs at the cost of reduced confidence that the application is working for its users.

Next  we’ll  take  a  look  at  how  we  can  use  Webrat  to  implement  either the Simulated Browser or Automated Browser style to do just that.
