2.1  Installation

If you haven’t done so already, the first thing you’ll need to do is 
install the  rspec  and  cucumber  gems.1  Open  a  shell,  and  type  the  
following (you may need to prefix this with sudo on some systems):

gem install rspec --version 2.0.0

Now type rspec --help, and you should see output that starts like this:

Usage: rspec [options] [files or directories]

If you don’t see that, or something close, then the installation failed for 
any number of reasons. If that happened, we recommend you email the 
rspec-users mailing list. All the authors of this book and many other 
knowledgeable  members  of  the  community  are  members  and  will  be 
happy to help you sort it out.2


1.  We assume that you already have a basic working knowledge of Ruby and 
Rubygems.
If you don’t, we can recommend Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers’ 
Guide
[TFH05] to learn about Ruby 1.8 and/or Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic 
Program- mers’ Guide [TFH08] if you want to learn about Ruby 1.9.

Assuming all is well so far, the next thing to do is install Cucumber by 
typing this:

gem install cucumber --version 0.9.2

Again,  you  may need to prefix  this  command with  sudo  on  some sys- 
tems. Now type cucumber --help, and you should see output that starts 
something like this:

Usage: cucumber [options] [ [FILE|DIR|URL][:LINE[:LINE]*] ]+

In the unlikely event of a Cucumber installation failure, please consult 
the Cucumber Google group for assistance.3

Now that the tools are installed, it’s time to say hello!
