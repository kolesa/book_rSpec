18.5  Background

Backgrounds let us write steps once that will be invoked before every scenario in a given feature. We use them instead of Before hooks when we want the steps to be visible in the feature file because they create logical context for each scenario.

Consider the act of logging in to a website. Many websites offer a limited set of functionality to users who are not logged in and more functionality for those who are.

When writing features for such a system, we often find it necessary to start every scenario with either Given I am logged in or Given I am logged out (or some variants of this). For cases like this, Cucumber allows us to define common steps in a Background:

Feature: invite friends

Background: Logged in
	Given I am logged in as "Aslak"
	And the following people exist:
		| name   | friend? |
		| David  | yes     |
		| Vidkun | no      |

Scenario: Invite someone who is already a friend

Scenario: Invite someone who is not a friend

Scenario: Invite someone who doesn't have an account

A  Background  will  run  before  each  of  our  scenarios,  just  like  a  Before hook  in  code.  If  there  are  any  Before  hooks,  they  will  run  before  the Background.
 
When we have a common setup, we usually have a choice whether to use Before or Background. Which one to use boils down to whether it is valuable to be explicit about it in the feature.
