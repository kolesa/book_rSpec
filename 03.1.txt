3.1  Introducing Codebreaker

Codebreaker is a  logic game in which  a code-breaker  tries to break a secret  code  created  by  a  code-maker.  The  code-maker,  which  will  be played by the application we’re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.

The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers (again, 1 to 6). The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and -
signs.

A +  indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.

A  -  indicates  a  number  match:  one  of  the  numbers  in  the  guess  is the  same as one  of  the numbers  in the  secret code  but in a  different position.

For example, given a secret code 1234, a guess with 4256 would earn a +-. The + is for the 2 in the second position in the guess, which matches the 2 in the secret code in both number and position: an exact match. The - is for the 4 in the first position in the guess, which matches the 4 in the code but not in the same position: a number match.

The  plus  signs  for  the  exact  matches  always  come  before  the  minus signs for the number matches and don’t align with specific positions in the guess or the secret code.
