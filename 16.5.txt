16.5  Global Hooks

The Configuration object also has hooks you can use to add blocks that are evaluated before, after, or around examples:

before(scope = :each, options={}, &block)  Adds  the  submitted  block to  the  end  of  a  list  of  blocks  that  get  evaluated  before  examples that match the submitted scope and options. scope can be any of :each,:all, or :suite. If :each, the block is run before each matching example. If :all, the block is run once per group, before any matching examples have been run. If :suite, the block is run once before any example groups have run.

after(scope = :each, options={}, &block)  Adds the submitted block to the beginning of the list of after blocks that get run by every example group. See before( ), earlier, for notes about scope and filtering.

around(options={}, &block)  Allows  you  to  wrap  behavior  around  examples by passing the example to the supplied block. This is especially  useful  when  working  with  a  library  that  exposes  facilities through  methods  that  accept  a  block.  The  most  obvious  example is database transactions. Here’s an example using the Sequel library with Rails 3:

RSpec.configure do |config|
	config.around { |example| DB.transaction &example }
end

Every example is passed to this block, which executes the example in the context of a Sequel transaction. This leaves Sequel responsible  for  managing  the  details  of  the  transaction  and  keeps  the configuration nice and clean.
